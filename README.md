# learning-typescript
A repository where I take notes based on different tutorials and create step by step instructions to complete tutorials at my own pace.

The purpose of the step-by-step guides is to cultivate skills to read code and to branch out from the video tutorials in order to apply what I'm learning.

At the time of this writing, the notes taken are based off of a typescript tutorial created by Shaun at netninja.dev

When notes are completed, this repository will function as a sort of sandbox for my typescript based projects.
